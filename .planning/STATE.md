# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-04)

**Core value:** Clients always know exactly what's happening with their job — no more chasing contractors for updates, no more scheduling conflicts, no more missed appointments.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 8 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of 5 in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-04 — Roadmap created, all 24 v1 requirements mapped to 8 phases

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Foundation: Flutter 3.32+ / Drift 2.32 / Riverpod 3.2 / go_router chosen; all versions verified against pub.dev 2026-03-04
- Foundation: FastAPI 0.135.1 + SQLAlchemy 2.0 + asyncpg; psycopg2 explicitly excluded (blocks async event loop)
- Foundation: PostgreSQL RLS + EXCLUDE USING GIST constraint mandatory from first migration — non-recoverable if retrofitted
- Foundation: Offline-first from first line of Flutter code — no UI widget may await HTTP directly
- Phase 2: Phase 3 (Scheduling Engine) depends only on Phase 1 — can run in parallel with Phase 2 if needed
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Flutter scaffold: uuid in runtime deps, setupServiceLocator async-ready, generated files excluded from git
- [Phase 01-foundation]: Drift pattern: tables in separate files under tables/, UUID PKs via clientDefault, primaryKey override not customConstraint

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 2 (Sync Engine): Conflict resolution strategy per entity type needs explicit decisions before planning — field-merge vs. server-wins decision matrix not fully specified
- Phase 3 (Scheduling Engine): Travel time API selection (Google Maps vs. OpenRouteService vs. OSRM) needs cost/quota modeling before planning
- Phase 3 (Scheduling Engine): Multi-day availability blocking algorithm needs formal specification before planning
- Phase 5 (Calendar UI): Flutter calendar drag-and-drop library not yet selected — needs research during plan-phase
- Phase 6 (Auth — deferred to v2): Multi-tenant login UX (how users identify their company at login) unspecified
- Flutter SDK not installed — flutter pub get and build_runner cannot run until SDK is installed
